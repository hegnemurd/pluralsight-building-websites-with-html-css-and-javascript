Hi! 

Welcome to the GitHub repository of Bethany's pie shop.
This app is the demo app for the Pluralsight course [Working With Text and Lists in HTML](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/working-text-lists-html).

You can download a copy of the code and follow along in the course.

The repository contains multiple branches that represent the state of the code at certain moments in the course. You can either clone the repository and switch through the branches using your favorite development environment (like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) or download the code for each branch individually by using the branch dropdownlist in GitHub.

Thank you for visiting this repository and keep learning!
